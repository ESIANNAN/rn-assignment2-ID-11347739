The task was about creating an expo andriod app. We were then asked to change the background of the view component and to make some text bold.

Running the commands was a bit difficilt because I kept on getting errors after running npm andriod. But I successfully found a way by watching a few youtube
videos ato solve the issue. The instructions were for each student to make a text saying "My name is Philomina" and to change the background color and to make the word Philomina bold.

I decided to make the word 'Philomina' bold by using a different class in an already made class because if I decide to call out the class in the css component and make it bold, it will affect the whole text. The font size was changed to 24 as instructed and I decided to use a shade of pink (#FFB6C1). I got the color code from a CSS color chart I found on the internet.

I committed every staged changes to my github account. Every saved work on VS code refreshes the application on the expo app which helps if to know if you're writing the good codes for the app and to check the development as well.
